**MP³** (Medical software for Processing multi-Parametric images Pipelines) is an open source software aimed to support preclinical and clinical researchers for image processing studies. This Matlab toolbox offers a graphical interface that helps to process medical images.>

**Features :** Here are the most important tools included in MP³

Import medical images (e.g. DICOM, NIFTI, Bruker, …) and convert them to nifti/json format
Visualize images (2D to 5D data)
Process (e.g. registration, model fit, filters, …)
Analyze (e.g. ROIs, scatterplots, …) medical images
Standard processes from SPM or FSL can be called as well as custom fonctions. Complex postprocessing pipelines can be created and applied to mutiparametric (e.g. MRI T1w + MRI T2w,…), multidimensional (e.g. spatial +temporal+echoes,…) or multimodal (e.g. MRI +CT, …) data. Once defined in a single patient, these processes can be stored and applied to a larger database using parallel architectures. MP³ was initially created in the Grenoble Institute of Neurosciences (France) to process multiparametric MRI protocols (anatomy+relaxometry+perfusion) in cohorts of +500 animals.
