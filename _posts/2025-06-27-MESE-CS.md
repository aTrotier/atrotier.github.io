Hello everyone,

We’re excited to announce the release of a **custom MRI acquisition sequence** for Paravision PV6.0.1 and PV360.3.5 and PV360.3.6 recently published in MRM : https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.30146

This sequence implements a **3D T2 mapping method with a Multi-Echo Spin Echo sequence and an advanced subspace reconstruction**.

You can find all the necessary resources to perform the reconstruction on GitHub : [PAPER_subspace_MESE](https://github.com/CRMSB/PAPER_subspace_MESE)

## Key Features:
- **Fast 3D T2 mapping**: In-vivo T2 mapping of the brain with isotropic resolution of 156um in 25 minutes
![](https://github.com/CRMSB/PAPER_subspace_MESE/blob/main/docs/src/img/fig_bart_julia.png?raw=true)
- **Subspace reconstruction**: Speeds up data acquisition by a factor of 8 using the prior knowledge of the temporal behavior of the signal evolution

Reconstruction: Reconstruction is performed offline from the rawdata with a dedicated Julia package using either [MRIReco.jl](https://github.com/MagneticResonanceImaging/MRIReco.jl) or [BART](https://mrirecon.github.io/bart/).

## Notes

This package is still a Work-In-Progress : Contributions, feedback, and questions are welcome on the GitHub repository.

Feel free to explore, test, and share your experiences with this advanced sequence!

Best regards,
